# My-Own-Mini-Salt-Project
This is a repository for Configuration Management Systems - Palvelinten Hallinta ICT4TN022-3018 - Autumn 2022 course's final module.

This Salt project's purpose is to demonstrate some of the things we were taught during this eight week course. I will try to make a salt state that downloads and installs some useful applications for ICT students, such as Zoom video confrencing and Visual Studio Code.

# The beginnign of the project

Most of the course the Salt exercises were done locally with one computer so I decided that as a part of this project I want to set up two completely new computers, one being the master computer and the other being the minion computer.

For both of my computers I used the same operating system which was Linux Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. </br>
I created both computers as virtual machines in VirtualBox version 6.1. I will have the.

I named the computers as the following screen captures show:
