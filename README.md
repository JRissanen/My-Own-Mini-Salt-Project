# h7 My Own Mini Salt Project
This is a repository for Configuration Management Systems - Palvelinten Hallinta ICT4TN022-3018 - Autumn 2022 course's final module.

# Introduction

This Salt project's purpose is to demonstrate some of the things we were taught during this eight week course. I will try to make a salt state that downloads and installs some useful applications for ICT students, such as Zoom video confrencing and Visual Studio Code.

This project will also show you how you can make two new virtual machines on VirtualBox communicate with each other with SaltStack as one of the new machines being a Salt-master computer and the other being a Salt-minion computer.

Most of the course the Salt exercises were done locally with one computer so I decided that as a part of this project I want to set up two completely new computers, one being the master computer and the other being the minion computer.

I created both computers as virtual machines in VirtualBox version 6.1. </br>
For both of my computers I used the same operating system which was Linux Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS with the desktop image. The link for downloading said OS: https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/ 

I named the computers as the following screen captures show:
